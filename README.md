<h1>PROJECT 1 - Banking System</h1>
<p>
  Banking system is a quite popular project idea for me it's a very interesting one because in this project I've implemented my OOP knowledge and by creating this I have known 
  about a lot of new techniques and ways to implement a particular thing in context to real life. In this system I've added operations like:<br><br> 
  <b>
    <i>
        • ADD ACCOUNT <br>
        • WITHDRAW <br>
        • DEPOSIT <br>
        • DISPLAY BALANCE <br><br>
    </i>
  </b>
  All the operations implemented in this are of our day to day life used in ATMs & online banking platforms. Below is an example of the system: <br><br>

 
```rust
1. ADD ACCOUNT   2. DISPLAY ACCOUNT INFO    3. WITHDRAW   4. DEPOSIT    5. DISPLAY BALANCE    6. EXIT 
Enter your choice : 1 
Enter account holders name: Sudipto 
Enter account number: 411145789  
ACCOUNT CREATED SUCCESSFULLY ! 
1. ADD ACCOUNT   2. DISPLAY ACCOUNT INFO   3. WITHDRAW   4. DEPOSIT    5. DISPLAY BALANCE     6. EXIT 
Enter your choice : 3 
Enter account number: 411145789 
Enter amount to withdraw: 500 
INSUFFICIENT BALANCE! TRANSACTION FAILED 
```

<h1>PROJECT 2 - Quiz System</h1>
<p>One of my favourite project ideas, an user choice based quiz system that consists of MCQ questions and users need to choose to continue playing or exit the system. Based on their number of correct answer choices they will get score. Below is a demo: <br><br>

 ```rust
 What type of device allows you to control your smart home devices with your voice? 
 1.Smartwatch 
 2.Smart TV 
 3.Smart Speaker 
 4.Tablet 
 Enter correct option: 3
 YOUR ANSWER IS CORRECT ! 
 Do you want to continue ? (Y - yes || N - no)Enter your choice: n 

 Your total score is: 5 out of 35 
```

<h1>PROJECT 3 - Expense Tracker</h1>
<p>
  This one is the most interesting project and completely enjoyed while creating this starting from thinking the logic, the operations, the implementation and how everything will perform. Like the project name, It is not only limited to track expense but it also has operation to split the expenses among all the persons. Although there has been a lot of points which I kept in mind while creating the operation logic and even the exceptions. It was a user choice based and user will choose what operation he/she wants to perform. The operations include: <br><br>
<b>
  <i>
  • ADD EXPENSE <br>
  •  DELETE EXPENSE <br>
  • VIEW ALL EXPENSE INFO <br>
  • VIEW TOTAL EXPENSE AMOUNT <br>
  • SPLIT EXPENSE <br> <br>
  </i>
</b>

  Below is a demo of the system:
 ```rust
 1.ADD EXPENSE     2.DELETE EXPENSE   3.VIEW ALL EXPENSES     4.TOTAL EXPENSE AMOUNT     5.SPLIT EXPENSE     6.EXIT 
 Enter your choice: 1

 Enter expense amount: 5000 
 Enter expense description: amazon delivery 
 Enter expense date (DD/MM/YYYY): 27/06/2024 
 EXPENSE ADDED SUCCESSFULLY ! 
```

<h1>PROJECT 4 - Library Management System</h1>
<p>
  Library management system is a mini system where day to day operations of a library is performed. Here users can register them, log in their account and choose what operations they want to perform. It was completely implemented using OOP concept. Operations include like: <br><br>
  <b>
    <i>
      • REGISTER || LOG IN <br>
      • ADD BOOK <br>
      • DELETE BOOK <br>
      • ISSUE BOOK <br>
      • RETURN BOOK <br>
      • CHECK AVAILABLE BOOKS <br><br>
  </i>
  </b>
Below is an example of how the system works: 
  
```rust
1.REGISTER   2.LOG IN 
Enter your choice: 2 
Enter your username: sudipto 
Enter your password: 12345 
YOU ARE NOT REGISTERED ! 
DO YOU WANT TO REGISTER YOURSELF NOW ? (Y - yes | N - no): y 
Enter username: sudipto 
Enter password: 12345 
REGISTRATION SUCCESSFULL ! 
1.ADD BOOK   2.DELETE BOOK   3.VIEW ALL BOOKS    4.SEARCH BOOK    5.VIEW ISSUED BOOKS    6.ISSUE BOOK    7.RETURN BOOK    8.LOGOUT 
Enter your choice: 
```

<h1>PROJECT 5 - Student Information System</h1>
<p>
  Presenting a mini project where I implemented file handling concept along with upscaled exception handling. A system that keeps record of students name, course, roll no and where we can perform operations like: <br><br>
  <b>
    <i>
      • ADD STUDENT <br>
      • DELETE STUDENT <br>
      • SEARCH STUDENT <br>
      • UPDATE STUDENT <br> <br>
    </i>
  </b>

Below is an example of the system: <br>
```rust
1.ADD STUDENT    2.DELETE STUDENT    3.SEARCH STUDENT     4.UPDATE STUDENT     5.EXIT 
Enter your choice: 1 
Enter students name: Sudipto Das 
Enter student course (INITIALS ONLY): BCA 
Enter 10-digit student roll no: 3090122258 
STUDENT SUCCESSFULLY ADDED ! 
```

<h1>PROJECT 6 - Online Food Ordering System</h1>
<p>
  One of my most complicated code that I've ever written in my life till now, still I would say by creating this system from complete scratch I have developed my logic building and upscaled my OOP implementation also in addition I've handled exceptions in a much better way in compared to previous systems. In this project also I have implemented file handling concepts but with a level up. While completing this i have taken help of some file handling documentations by which I got some of my doubts cleared regarding certain implementation techniques. Though it is a very broad system mentioning some of its operations can be confusing, below I am providing a short demo of the system.

<h1>PROJECT 7 - To-Do List</h1>
<p>
  It is no wonder that creating a todo list has became a ritual for developers for improving logic and implementation techniques at initial stage so I thought I should also try to create one in C++ with OOP. And here I'm presenting my fully user choice based To-Do list built from complete scratch and even I added some of my own logics to improve operations, below is a demo on how the system works: <br> 

  ```rust

<h1>PROJECT 8 - Mini DSA Implementation</h1>
<p>
  In this project I've implemented some of the DSA concepts like: <br><br>
  <b><i>
  • ARRAYS <br>
  • LINKED LIST <br>
  • STACK <br>
  • QUEUE <br>
  • SORTING ALGORITHMS <br>
  • SEARCHING ALGORITHMS </i></b> <br> <br>
  Through this project users can interract with the system and can see implementations of different data structures and some algorithms. Though for now, I have added just a few DSA concepts and planning to introduce more like this in future projects.<br>
  Here's a demo of how the system works:<br>


  ```rust
