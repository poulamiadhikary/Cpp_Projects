<h1>Expense Tracker</h1>
<p>
  Completely enjoyed while creating this, starting from thinking the logic, the operations, the implementation and how everything will perform. Like the project name, It is not only limited to track expense but it also has operation to split the expenses among all the persons. Although there has been a lot of points which I kept in mind while creating the operation logic and even the exceptions. It was a user choice based and user will choose what operation he/she wants to perform. The operations include: <br><br>
<b>
  <i>
  • ADD EXPENSE <br>
  • DELETE EXPENSE <br>
  • VIEW ALL EXPENSE INFO <br>
  • VIEW TOTAL EXPENSE AMOUNT <br>
  • SPLIT EXPENSE <br> <br>
  </i>
</b>

  Below is a demo of the system:
 ```rust
 1.ADD EXPENSE     2.DELETE EXPENSE   3.VIEW ALL EXPENSES     4.TOTAL EXPENSE AMOUNT     5.SPLIT EXPENSE     6.EXIT 
 Enter your choice: 1

 Enter expense amount: 5000 
 Enter expense description: amazon delivery 
 Enter expense date (DD/MM/YYYY): 27/06/2024 
 EXPENSE ADDED SUCCESSFULLY ! 
```
